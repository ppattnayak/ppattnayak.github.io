I'm Priyaranjan Pattnayak â€” a Senior Principal Data Scientist at Oracle Cloud.  
I lead projects on Generative AI, NLP, and enterprise-scale multimodal systems.

My work focuses on building production-grade AI frameworks that power real-world business experiences, combining deep learning, tokenization research, document understanding, and conversational agents.

You can find my publications, blogs, and recorded talks here.
