excerpt: "Senior Principal Data Scientist at Oracle Cloud. Researcher in NLP, Generative AI, and large-scale AI systems."
---

I'm Priyaranjan Pattnayak — a Senior Principal Data Scientist at Oracle Cloud.  
I lead projects on Generative AI, NLP, enterprise-scale multilingual and multimodal systems.

My work focuses on building production-grade AI frameworks that power real-world business experiences, combining deep learning, tokenization research, document understanding, and conversational agents.

You can find my publications, blogs, and recorded talks here.
